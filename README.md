# matlab_key_lines
Scaling.py takes 2 arguments; a collapsed m file which is created by paceGVI/utilities/createCollapsedMFile.py, and 
a variable you wish to scale.

A collapsed m file is basically taking all the m files from a given directory and catenating them together.

The variable you wish to change can be any variable set in an m file.

The output of scaling.py is all the m file lines that are required to scale the given variable you wish to change.

This is used to scale an initial data file you have in matlab.
